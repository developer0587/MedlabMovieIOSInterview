This is an app about movies information has to be developed. It displays a list of movies so when you tap on one, another view is displayed with the movie information. 

Also, the app storage locally favorites movies so the user can remember which movies has enjoyed more.
For this the user taps on the grey star from the DetaildViewController.  
So next time when user resumes the app he would see the star marked as yellow indicating he enjoyed the movie more.
